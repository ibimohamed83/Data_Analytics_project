# Data_Analytics_project
This project explores the recent studies on predicting household energy usage using IoT sensor data generated from the smart home sensors e.g., temperature sensor. It compares with the existing time-series data model with the deep learning prediction models that can capture time dependent variables. 

The project also explains common design practices, including feature engineering, eval-
uation methods and challenges observed. At the end, it will identify the gaps around interpretability and translates the forecast into a more visual dashboard insights.
